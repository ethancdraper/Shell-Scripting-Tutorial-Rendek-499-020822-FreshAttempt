What I learnt last time was that Atom is a text editor (so is VI but it sucks, we don’t like it). In a text editor, you can write your code. That is something that you can save to GitHub so that it its publicly available (this lets people check your work, replicate it, collaborate on it, and also just use it for their own projects). I think that GitHub = kinda like a publicly accessible Google Drive (can be shared, collaboratively edited, etc.). After you have your commands written (reminder, your file should end in .sh because it is Shell; think the difference between Shell or any other things is like Word vs Google Docs), you can run it in your terminal. In a terminal you can also type your commands and have them happen instantly, or you can execute programs that you have code written in (ex. the commands you just put into Atom). Compared to last time, I know that writing something in Atom is not going to make anything happen (ex. writing 'date' in Atom will put it in a document -like writing it in Word) so you have to do it in a terminal (then if you write 'date' it will actually output the date). Or alternatively, you can make your terminal run your .sh Atom file (but that’s the part I’m having trouble with still). Still not discouraged!
